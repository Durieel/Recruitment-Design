# Recruitment-Design

Task: Create 4 connected responsive views. You can use framework like VueJs or React or plain HTML5/JS/CSS. Code should be presented as github repository. It should work locally. Using CSS preprocessors like SASS/LESS would be appreciated. Alternatively, you can try Bootstrap library. Be aware of accessible needs (for users with disabilities).
